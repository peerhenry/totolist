# totolist
Test todolist app: typescript, react, redux, immutable, webpack, mocha, enzyme, gulp.

## Setup
After cloning or downloading, run `npm install` to install all packages, then run `gulp fetch` to copy required js libraries to the build/libs folder.
To build the application, run `webpack`, and if you want to open the index page automatically after build (with chrome), run `npm run build`

Unit tests are also built with webpack, and run with mocha. To build, run and view a nice report in the form of a browserpage, simply run `gulp`.
